# AoC2022

Finally, the chillest month of the year has come.

I'll do the AoC with Golang, beacause I want to practice it more.
More seriously, AoC is such a good opportunity to get more confortable with a language

Anyway, this is chilling time and I'm no hardcore programming duded, so this is just for me to have fun solving this puzzles

I wish to have fun and good luck for this AoC and Happy Holidays!
